            <dt>Superman</dt>
            <dd id="supeman" class="invisible">Originally the Man of Steel only had the power to leap tall buildings with a single bound. But when artists set out to animate Superman for a cartoon in the 1940s, they decided it was too difficult to draw him bending his knees to jump. They gave him the ability to fly in an effort to make the animation seamless.
            </dd>
            <dt>Batman</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Batman’s real name, Bruce Wayne, has historical roots. He was named for Scottish national hero Robert the Bruce and Mad Anthony Wayne, a hero of the American Revolution, according to IGN. And if you’re wondering how the Caped Crusader navigates social media, his screen name, used in the comics, is JonDoe297.         </dd>
            <dt>Spiderman</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Stan Lee was inspired to create Spider-Man by a flying insect crawling on a wall rather than an actual spider. When Lee spied the bug, he considered that his next superhero should be one that can stick to vertical surfaces. After toying around with several different names, the comic book genius landed on Spider-Man. And the rest, as they say, is history.
            </dd>
            <dt>Captain America</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">The superhero we know and love as Captain America almost had a very different moniker. The shield-wielding dude was originally created in 1940 as a response to World War II (so this guy has heaps of history) but was first named Super American. The name didn’t last long because the creators felt there were too many superheroes using “super” in their ID. Captain America was born.
            </dd>
            <dt>Ironman</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">If you’re familiar with Iron Man, you know that Tony Stark refers to his artificial intelligence system as JARVIS. The name sounds sophisticated (much like Stark himself) but what JARVIS actually stands for is anything but. It’s simply an acronym for Just A Rather Very Intelligent System.
            </dd>
            <dt>Thor</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Did you know he’s one superhero that was actually able to accomplish the unthinkable? At one time, Thor (using the magical power of the Odinforce) put a dent in Captain America’s practically-impossible-to-destroy shield using Mjolnir.
            </dd>
            <dt>Black Panther</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Black Panther wears a Vibranium uniform, claws, and boots, while Captain America’s shield is made of the super-strong stuff. In fact, Black Panther’s home of Wakanda mines Vibranium, making them one of the richest nations on Earth (in the comics, that is).
            </dd>
            <dt>The Hulk</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">When Hulk was originally drawn for the comics, he was actually grey. Unfortunately, the grey ink didn’t print very well, so the big guy was changed to the green hue we know today.
            </dd>
            <dt>Star-Lord</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">If you’ve ever wondered how Star-Lord can be one of the Guardians of the Galaxy without wearing some type of helmet to survive in space, Marvel.com might just have the answer. He did wear a costume to help his space survival and that ensemble may have changed him physically, making it easy for him to zoom through air and space.
            </dd>
            <dt>Many Superheros</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Did you know many of your favorite superheroes have middle names? Spider-Man’s real-life alias is Peter Benjamin Parker, and Hulk’s full moniker is Robert Bruce Banner. Superman’s middle name is Joseph, while Iron Man is Anthony Edward “Tony” Stark. If you want to get formal with Daredevil, he goes by Matthew Michael Murdock, and Star-Lord’s birth certificate reads Peter Jason Quill.
